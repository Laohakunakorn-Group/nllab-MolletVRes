The data were collected in LBNC-EPFL and consists of DNA titrations. Each reaction consists of the following components:

* 3.5 uM GamS protein
* E. coli Rosetta lysate
* 3PGA energy solution
* varying concentrations of linear ZF10-pBEST-deGFP-NL22 DNA obtained by serial dilution from a stock of 60.3 nM. The concentrations (in nM) are:

	conds = [
	60.3,
	44.5,
	22.25,
	11.125,
	5.5625,
	2.78125,
	1.390625,
	0.6953125,
	0.34765625]

The reaction volume is 10 uL, and data were measured every 2 min for 12 h in a BioTek Synergy plate reader at 29C with excitation/emission settings of 488/507+/-9 nm. Each condition was repeated in triplicate, and standard deviations are given.
